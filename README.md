Image Caption Generator

Introduction
The Image Caption Generator is a Python-based project that uses deep learning techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. This project aims to combine computer vision and natural language processing to create meaningful and contextually relevant captions for a wide range of images.

Image captioning has various applications, including:

Enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
Improving image indexing and retrieval.
Adding context to social media posts.
Enriching content for blogs and websites.
And many more!
This project utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for natural language generation. It can be used as a standalone application or integrated into other projects.

Features
Automatic generation of captions for input images.
Customizable model architecture and training parameters.
Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
User-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
Easy integration into existing applications through a Python API.

Prerequisites
Before using the Image Caption Generator, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pillow (PIL)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
tqdm (for progress bars)
